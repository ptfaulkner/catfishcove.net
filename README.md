===============
Simple restaurant web site I put together for my cousin's fish camp.  The site is build with ASP.NET MVC, with a simple SQL Compact database backend to house the menu and sunday buffet items.  The frontend utilizes the [semantic ui](http://semantic-ui.com/) framework and is fully responsive.
